<h4>What is it?</h4>
<p>sfdoc is a <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> web app that runs on Heroku and publishes documentation from an <a href="https://easydita.com/">easyDITA</a> instance to a Salesforce org as Knowledge Articles.</p>
<h4>How does it work?</h4>
<p>
  HTML output is generated by easyDITA using the DITA Open Toolkit and sent to sfdoc where it is scrubbed using a set of whitelists.
  Images are uploaded to Amazon S3 and image links in the HTML are updated accordingly.
  Two Salesforce orgs are needed: One is the production org and the other is a sandbox org to use for reviewing changes before going live in production.
</p>
<h4>Can I use it with my own easyDITA instance and Salesforce orgs?</h4>
<p>Yes! sfdoc is an open source project developed by <a href="http://www.salesforce.org/">Salesforce.org</a> and hosted at <a href="https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation/sfdoc">GitHub</a>. For information on setting up your own instance of sfdoc, please see the repo readme file.</p>
