<h4>What is it?</h4>
<p>sfdoc is a Django web app that runs on Heroku and publishes documentation from an easyDITA instance to a Salesforce org as Knowledge Articles.</p>
<h4>How does it work?</h4>
<p>
  HTML output is generated by easyDITA using the DITA Open Toolkit and sent to sfdoc where it is scrubbed using a set of whitelists.
  Images are uploaded to Amazon S3 and image links in the HTML are updated accordingly.
  Articles are first uploaded as drafts, then published after review and approval.
</p>
<h4>Can I use it with my own easyDITA instance and Salesforce org?</h4>
<p>Yes! sfdoc is an open source project developed by <a href="http://www.salesforce.org/">Salesforce.org</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation/sfdoc">hosted at GitHub</a>. For information on setting up your own instance of sfdoc, please see the repo readme file.</p>
